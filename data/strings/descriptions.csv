# STATIONS,,,,,
# Removed from Lyra for brevity #  The advanced technologies involved are the source of great grievance among Luddic theologians, but, in practice, it means that the presence of independent traders and visitors is only barely tolerated.,,
kol_lyra_desc,CUSTOM,"The stronghold and command center of the Luddic Knights is the embodiment of their beliefs and their compromises. Heavy batteries and plentiful garden chambers keep the many faithful safe, living and practicing in lush open spaces, even in cold vacuum of space. Military centers coordinate system-wide fleets, which are sourced from the proscribed acts of shipbuilding and fuel production carried out here as an open secret.",,"Lyra station's gardens are green pockmarks below your parking orbit, each growing between metroplex fora, comm-array towers, solar collecters, and batteries. Beneath them lie the shipbuilding forges and antimatter condensers that power the Knight's Armada, invisible to the naked eye but detectable by the telltale emission patterns of neutrinos and other charged particles. The tactical overlay of your Tri-pad helpfully marks many decorative steeples as likely weapon emplacements.",
# Removed from Cygnus: Etchings of swans, with wings stylized to resemble ancient kite shields, are visible across the outer plating.,,,
kol_cygnus_desc,CUSTOM,"The highest calling of the Luddic Knights is the protection of the Church, and Battlestation Cygnus was constructed as the first line of system defense. Logisticians, technicians, and other staff make up a martial civilian populace embracing the station mantra: 'One faith, lasting aegis.'",,"Battlestation Cygnus is a constant buzz of activity. Personnel part to allow smartly adorned crew to rush about, giving anybody with visible cybernetics hard stares before muttering darkly into their headpieces.",
kol_libra_port_desc,CUSTOM,"The Battlestar Libra. A station, turned colony ship, turned warship, turned station again. Now a mere port in the wild fringes of the sector, Libra yearns in her every bolt to return to the stars, a dream now painfully far from reach. The years and the battles have greatly decayed this once-proud ship, but some would still call it their home.",,,
,,,,,
# WEAPONS,,,,,
# Large,,,,,
kol_caelia,WEAPON,"A variant of the Hephaestus assault gun given a larger bore size by luddic engineers and loaded with explosive shells. While undoubtedly effective, the incredible heat generated during fire easily deforms the cannon's more delicate components, and sustained salvoes readily devolve into undirected fire.",,,
kol_llyr,WEAPON,"A variant of the Caelia assault gun modified to fire depleted uranium kinetic penetrators. Excellent at bringing down enemy shields and causing an overload. While undoubtedly effective, the incredible heat generated during fire easily deforms the cannon's more delicate components, and sustained salvoes readily devolve into undirected fire.",,,
kol_lunete,WEAPON,"A large, powerful emitter that generates a lance of plasma though the controlled detonation of a neon medium.  First designed for Onslaught battleships operating far from core Domain space where the complex parts required to maintain Thermal Pulse Cannons could not be readily supplied.",,,
# Medium,,,,,
kol_bricole,WEAPON,"An unassuming up-rated variant of the Arbalest, the Bricole Cannon delivers respectable damage at above-average ranges, but wins no awards for assault potential. The Bricole tends to find a home on skirmishers with a need to outrange the classic Heavy Autocannon without paying a premium.",,,
# Small,,,,,
kol_tor,WEAPON,"A lower caliber and less demanding version of the Mauler cannon, firing antimatter charged munitions that are highly effective at destroying enemy armor. Manufacturing such an advanced weapon system is beyond the normal means of the Church, and most of these are traded by the Hegemony as part armament transfer treaties that date back to the First AI War.",,,
kol_drian,WEAPON,"A nearly forgotten predecessor of the modern railgun, the Drian fires magnetized slugs at modest range and for modest damage. Its prime claim to fame is its highly efficient firing cycle, and that it can be manufactured without cutting-edge facilities. This weapon provides the assurance that no matter what else may happen, the bearer will be delivering rounds downrange",,,
# Built-in,,,,,
kol_brimstone,WEAPON,"""Point towards heathen.""",- Unknown pather,,
,,,,,
# SHIPS,,,,,
# Frigates,,,,,
kol_sundew,SHIP,"To confuse a Mudskipper and a Sundew is to confuse a Luddic with a Pather - or, indeed, a Knight. Though there are similarities, the Sundew is a fierce, shielded, armored, and highly mobile ship capable of quickly dusting any captains not taking it seriously.

According to Knight legend, the Sundew was designed after the defeat of Deacon-Captain John Grayne's Eos Exodus patrol by a substantially weaker pirate fleet. As the patrol navigated The Pilgrims belt, they were ambushed by armored frigates of unknown design. Deacon-Captain Grayne panicked, and his patrol was shredded. Combat logs revealed the pirate ships to be nothing more than Mudskippers, their profiles enlarged by cold-welded scrap to defeat the Knights' basic threat calculators. Not ones to be held back from a good idea by pride, the Knights quickly adopted a similar configuration into their own fleets - and to great effect.",,,
kol_protea,SHIP,"In a marked departure from standard doctrine, the Protea-class frigate eschews attached armor modules in favor of armored drones, giving it the freedom to choose when and where to thrust its oversize ballistic weaponry.",,,
# Destroyers,,,,,
kol_marigold,SHIP,"The Marigold is the Knights of Ludd's tempered answer to the Manticore. Cheaper to field and more flexible to outfit, it nonetheless lacks the firepower afforded by large ballistic weaponry. When faced with detractors, most Knights are quick to point out that the original Manticore is merely a Domain tool of war, and not a design worthy of the faithful's respect.",,,
kol_mimosa,SHIP,"A Mimosa provides effective support for a balanced fleet by painting opportune enemies with its LIDAR Array, shredding fighters with canister flak, and, if needed, absorbing stray fire with its armor modules. Never the hero of a battle, the Mimosa-class is nevertheless sorely missed by Knights forced to go without.",,,
kol_snowdrop,SHIP,"The Snowdrop is an experimental destroyer built over a radically altered and up-armed Vanguard-class hull. Evaluated as a whole, the modifications recall the technology systems utilized by Alysse class battleships:  removable ferro-ceramic armor modules replace the integral armor but remain linked to the ship’s dampening field; engine mass is downsized to permit the installation of a small Orion push plate; any and all saved space is crammed full of autoloaders and magazines to support a destroyer-level weaponry suite within the frigate-sized profile.  The deep alterations and cramped nature of the interior makes the class difficult to maintain and expensive to operate when compared with vessels of similar age and tonnage.",,,
# Cruisers,,,,,
kol_tamarisk,SHIP,"A prototypal light cruiser from the unification era of the Domain, the Tamarisk class was first designed as a convoy leader to defend logistic lines outside of established gate space. Unusual for its age, the class favors strike tactics, with most of its internal volume being split between oversized engine conduits and the munition citadels necessary to support a large complement of ballistic batteries.

Despite a successful service record, the class met an unceremonious end when the maturity of the gate system greatly simplified Domain military logistics. Many a Tamarisk was sold to frontier prospecting and defense outfits, but subsequent advancements in targeting technology and the later development of strike craft made the warship’s lack of integral armor an unsustainable vulnerability.",,,
kol_larkspur,SHIP,"Marveling at the cleanly-engineered systems and the surprising agility of the Larkspur-class cruiser is looked upon with studied disapproval, but, in private, even Knights are said to revel in the ""high-end"" tech it carries. As with most of the hulls birthed by Ceyx, its fury is directed forward, but flanking frigates would do well to tread carefully. The Omni-Lunge Canister Flak system has chastened many would-be opportunists.",,,
kol_lotus,SHIP,"The Knights' heavy support cruiser lurks behind the front lines, waiting for a target. Once a suitable foe wanders within range, it paints them with its laser array and pounds them with a rain of missiles.",,,
kol_blaze,SHIP,"Every Blaze is slightly different, as each is hacked together around the largest ship engine available, which is then turned around and tinkered with to jet plasma in a forward-facing stream. The rest of the ship exists only to feed the ravenous hunger of this monster, and deliver its wrath upon the enemies of Ludd.",,,
# Capital Ships,,,,,
kol_lunaria,SHIP,"Hulls are rarely ever truly lost in the sector. ""Today's wreck is tomorrow's Hound"" is an old mechanic saying, and the Lunaria-class artillery capital ship is the concept taken to its conclusion; a ship designed from the start to be built from the salvage of unfortunate Onslaughts. The iconic forward prongs chew through targets after being softened by heavy long-range batteries boosted by the terrifying LIDAR Array. Six slabs of armor protect it in close combat, but, like its progenitors, a meager two aft weapons leave it vulnerable to attack from behind.",,,
kol_alysse,SHIP,"A treasured battleship often found as the leading element within knight armadas, the Alysse achieves a seldomly seen combination of firepower, speed, and resilience through the implementation of novel if somewhat antiquated technologies. Four heavy ablative armor plates with independent flux grids and dampening field generators mount Vulcan and Flak point defense grids, with additional cannons keyed to fire following the activation of the Orion Drive. Defense is simply unparalleled so long as the modular plates hold. 

The Alysse once represented an evolutionary step for the militarization of the Orion Drive technology first implemented by the Retribution. The inclusion of robust modular plating serving a dual purpose, augmenting both survivability and relieving strain on the ship's inertial compensators. Strategic command likely remained unconvinced, and no combat or procurement records exist for the ship within known Domain Battlegroups.

Every Alysse-class vessel that exists today is a painstaking reconstruction of the forgotten prototypes, artisanally assembled and sanctified for their sacred duty to the Church.",,,
kol_hex,SHIP,"These crudely-slaved point defense drones serve the double duty of defending the vulnerable protea and embodying its fury. Though not high tech, they are potent at both screening light threats and at striking them down.",,,
,,,,,
# SHIP SYSTEMS,,,,,
kol_lunge,SHIP_SYSTEM,Launches the ship in the desired direction by dumping travel-drive fuel directly into maneuvering thrusters. Stores up to three charges at a time.,Movement,Launches the ship in the desired direction by dumping travel-drive fuel directly into maneuvering thrusters. Stores up to three charges at a time.,three
kol_onion,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Deploys a shaped antimatter charge behind the ship. The explosion applies force to a massive push-plate, which absorbs the shock and spreads the resulting acceleration over a timeframe where it can be handled by the ship's inertial compensators. The ship is briefly propelled forward at a rate very few more ""advanced"" technologies can hope to match.",Movement,"Explodes a shaped antimatter charge behind the ship, propelling it forward at extreme speed.",
kol_damper,SHIP_SYSTEM,Briefly activates an energy field that mitigates incoming damage to armor modules at the cost of disabling weapons and shields.,Defensive,Briefly activates an energy field that mitigates incoming damage to armor modules at the cost of disabling weapons and shields.,
kol_lidar,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Greatly increases the range, rate of fire, and accuracy of large turrets while temporarily standing down all other weapons. Reduces ship speed and turret turn rate when active.",Offensive,"Greatly increases the range, rate of fire, and accuracy of large turrets while temporarily standing down all other weapons. Reduces ship speed and turret turn rate when active.",

kol_hellfire,SHIP_SYSTEM,Briefly increases the damage of ballistic weapons. Causes intense heat buildup and must be cooled before reuse.,Offensive,Briefly increases the damage of ballistic weapons. Causes intense heat buildup and must be cooled before reuse.,
kol_drone_strike,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Supercharges one of the Hex drones with a brief energy transfer. The drone tracks a nearby target like a missile, dealing massive area damage on impact.",Offensive,"Supercharges one of the Hex drones and sends it after a target. The drone deals 1200 Energy damage and 600 EMP damage on impact, and charging it generates 600 flux.",1200 Energy | 600 EMP | 600
,,,,,
# FACTIONS,,,,,
knights_of_selkie,FACTION,"The military branch of the Luddic Church of Galactic Redemption, modeled on monastic warrior societies from previous millennia. Built and governed by a myriad of martial rituals that deftly reconcile Ludd's anti-militaristic revelations with the constrained bloodshed required by practical statecraft. The order's roots may be traced to the depths of Sector history, when the faithful fought alongside the founding fleets of the Hegemony to overcome the tyranny of Warlord Leonis and to shatter the technological yoke of the Tri-Tachyon Corporation.",,,
