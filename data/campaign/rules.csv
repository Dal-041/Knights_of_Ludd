$faction.id == knights_of_selkie score:1000",FireAll RelLevelMoreDescription,"The Knights of Ludd watch you with less suspicion than most spacers, and the Church welcomes you to the volumes they control.

$faction.id == knights_of_selkie score:1000",FireAll RelLevelMoreDescription,You are given preferential treatment over other spacers during security checks and are allowed to self-moderate unsubtle use of technologies without need for the heavy hand of the Knights of Ludd to guide you toward righteousness.,,

relLevelInhospitableKol,RelationshipLevelDesc,"$faction.rel == INHOSPITABLE
$faction.id == knights_of_selkie score:2000",FireAll RelLevelMoreDescription,"The Knights look wary upon you, and subject you to unnecessary delays and investigation.

$faction.id == knights_of_selkie score:2000",FireAll RelLevelMoreDescription,"The Church considers you a minion of Moloch, a slave to demonic technology. You are a witless ally of Mammon, and the Knights treat you as an agent of evil. Begone, or be subject to the wrath of the righteous.",,
relLevelVengefulKol,RelationshipLevelDesc,"$faction.rel == VENGEFUL
$faction.id == knights_of_selkie score:2000",FireAll RelLevelMoreDescription,"You have been deemed an enemy of Ludd.

The Knights' indoctrinal school for squires identifies you as the slavering dretch of every known demon, from Mammon, Moloch, and Belial all the way down to some possibly created just for you.",,
