$faction.id == knights_of_selkie score:1000",FireAll RelLevelMoreDescription,"You stay clear of the Knights of Ludd and they do not hinder your passage. Though you are ever watched by their patrols, comms are crisp and polite.",,
relLevelFavorableKol,RelationshipLevelDesc,"$faction.rel == FAVORABLE
$faction.id == knights_of_selkie score:1000",FireAll RelLevelMoreDescription,"Requests for your destination and purpose are notably lessened, if not absent. You respect their sometimes archaic protocols and they occasionally fail to scowl at your lifestyle.",,
relLevelWelcomingKol,RelationshipLevelDesc,"$faction.rel == WELCOMING
$faction.id == knights_of_selkie score:1000",FireAll RelLevelMoreDescription,"The Knights of Ludd watch you with less suspicion than most spacers, and the Church welcomes you to the volumes they control. You are an old hand at navigating their ways of operating and leave behind those technologies which cause alarm to the most wary Knights.",,
relLevelFriendlyKol,RelationshipLevelDesc,"$faction.rel == FRIENDLY
$faction.id == knights_of_selkie score:1000",FireAll RelLevelMoreDescription,You are given preferential treatment over other spacers during security checks and are allowed to self-moderate unsubtle use of technologies without need for the heavy hand of the Knights of Ludd to guide you toward righteousness.,,
relLevelCooperativeKol,RelationshipLevelDesc,"$faction.rel == COOPERATIVE
$faction.id == knights_of_selkie score:1000",FireAll RelLevelMoreDescription,The Knights of Ludd put great trust in your handling of technology for righteous cause. Your presence is seen as a boon to security and your sensor data packages are integrated into sector models. Even the most radical of Knights acknowledge your contribution.,,

relLevelSuspiciousKol,RelationshipLevelDesc,"$faction.rel == SUSPICIOUS
$faction.id == knights_of_selkie score:2000",FireAll RelLevelMoreDescription,You are seen as a typical spacer; dismissive of Ludd's revelation and scornful of the Church. The Knights of Ludd remind you of the moral importance of Technological Correctness during every tense interaction.,,
relLevelInhospitableKol,RelationshipLevelDesc,"$faction.rel == INHOSPITABLE
$faction.id == knights_of_selkie score:2000",FireAll RelLevelMoreDescription,"The Knights look warily upon you, and subject you to unnecessary delays and investigation. Curates of the Church of Galactic Redemption offer you as example of one led far astray from Ludd's revelation; one lost in the machine; perhaps not yet lost to Moloch, but an unwitting servant to evil.",,
relLevelHostileKol,RelationshipLevelDesc,"$faction.rel == HOSTILE
$faction.id == knights_of_selkie score:2000",FireAll RelLevelMoreDescription,"The Church considers you a minion of Moloch, a slave to demonic technology. You are a witless ally of Mammon, and the Knights treat you as an agent of evil. Begone, or be subject to the wrath of the righteous.",,
relLevelVengefulKol,RelationshipLevelDesc,"$faction.rel == VENGEFUL
$faction.id == knights_of_selkie score:2000",FireAll RelLevelMoreDescription,"You have been deemed an unholy foe. An Inquisitor has been assigned to carry out your termination, which they will name a righteous deed, just and honorable. The Knights' indoctrinal school for squires identifies you as the slavering dretch of every known demon, from Mammon, Moloch, and Belial all the way down to some possibly created just for you.",,

Frustratingly, the occupants were professional - everything that might contain any information on them was wiped clean from the lowest memory key to the vitally important delta-AI managing the station life support systems. However, what's clear is that this was a Tri-Tachyon operation, and Tri-Tachyon executives always have some dirt on the others, hiding them off the main systems and hidden away in shielded compartments. 

It doesn't take your crew long to locate a mag-safe box underneath the paneling in an engineering section, containing a memory key wrapped in organic-derived insulation. The Cache is obstinantly bio-locked, and only select sections of the key can be scraped off.
